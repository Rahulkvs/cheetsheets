Smart rounding
Another use of binary operators is rounding. Because they treat numbers as integers, all of them cut off the decimal part.
 ~~12.34 // 12
 
Smart division by power of 2
The right shift a >> b operator is actually same as a/(2^b).

Conditions can be grouped in brackets and negated by NOT:

var x = 15
 
if ( !(x<10 || x>20) ) {
  alert('The number is *inside* 10..20')
}
