you can use netstat to see which process is listening on which port.

I use this command to have a full detail :

sudo netstat -taupen
if you need to know exactly which one is listening on port 8000 you can use this :

sudo netstat -tapen | grep ":8000 "
There is no process that can hide from netstat.

then this command will list you the application used by that port with PID.

lsof -i :8000
