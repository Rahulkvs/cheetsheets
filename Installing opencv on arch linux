Well, we want the full install of OpenCV 3 to have access to features (no pun intended) such as SIFT and SURF.
In OpenCV 2.4, SIFT and SURF were included in the default installation of OpenCV. However, with the release of OpenCV 3+,
these packages have been moved to contrib, which houses either (1) modules that are currently in development or (2) modules
that are marked as “non-free” (i.e., patented). 





---------------------
After this, it is a  good idea to check if opencv was successfully installed by checking the libraries available for it via 

pkg-config --libs opencv

If the output lists a bunch of libraries, that’s good! If the command outputs something similar to the block below, then something definitely went wrong.

Package opencv was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing 'opencv.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'opencv' found
