rm filename	//removes files

By default, rm does not remove directories. If the -r (--recursive) option is specified, however, rm will remove any matching directories and their contents.

rm -i *

Attempt to remove every file in the working directory, but prompt before each file to confirm.

rm *           //no prompt unless file is write protected


==============users===========

usermod -l newUsername oldUsername

This however, doesn't rename the home folder.

To change home-folder, use

usermod -d /home/newHomeDir -m newUsername

===================FIND================================

-------------- Find Files Using Name-----------------

This is a basic usage of the find command. This example finds all files with name — MyCProgram.c in the current directory and all its sub-directories.

# find -name "MyCProgram.c"

------------ Inverting the match.-------------------

Shows the files or directories whose name are not MyCProgram.c .Since the maxdepth is 1, this will look only under current directory.

# find -maxdepth 1 -not -iname "MyCProgram.c



--------------------- Find Files Based on file-type using option -type-----------------

Find only the socket files.

# find . -type s

Find all directories

# find . -type d

Find only the normal files

# find . -type f

Find all the hidden files

# find . -type f -name ".*"

Find all the hidden directories

# find -type d -name ".*"




------------------Limit Search To Specific Directory Level Using mindepth and maxdepth--------------------

Find the passwd file under all sub-directories starting from root directory.

# find / -name passwd

Find the passwd file under root and one level down. (i.e root — level 1, and one sub-directory — level 2)

# find -maxdepth 2 -name passwd


Find the passwd file under root and two levels down. (i.e root — level 1, and two sub-directories — level 2 and 3 )

# find / -maxdepth 3 -name passwd


Find the password file between sub-directory level 2 and 4.

# find -mindepth 3 -maxdepth 5 -name passwd


------------------Executing Commands on the Files Found by the Find Command----------------

You can specify inode number on a find command as shown below. In this example, find command renames a file using the inode number.

# find -iname current_file_name.txt -exec mv {} new_test_file_name.txt
